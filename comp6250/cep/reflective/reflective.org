** Reflective writing /is/:
- documenting your response to experiences, opinions, events or new information
communicating your response to thoughts and feelings
- a way of exploring your learning
- an opportunity to gain self-knowledge
- a way to achieve clarity and better understanding of what you are learning
- a chance to develop and reinforce writing skills
- a way of making meaning out of what you study

** Reflective writing /is not/:
- just conveying information, instruction or argument
- pure description, though there may be descriptive elements
- straightforward decision or judgement, e.g. about whether something is right or wrong, good or bad
- simple problem-solving
- a summary of course notes
- a standard university essay.
