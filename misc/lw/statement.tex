Dear Student Administration and Academic Services,

My name is Zhiren Lin and my UID is u7753813. I am writing to request a late withdrawal of COMP6260 Foundation of Computation of 2023 Semester 2.

The reasons for this request are complex but mainly are
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\alph*)}, font=\bfseries]
\item the increasing confusion despite of a great amount of time and effort I have put into it;
\item other limitations such as my employment and my current economic conditions.
\end{enumerate*}
I will explain these reasons in detail in the rest part of this statement.

\section{More time is needed}
There are three reasons as to why the more I study, the more confused I feel about this topic.

First, COMP6260 is more about logic than math. You might wonder how this is a big deal. I had never been exposed to formal logic study before the course. As a complete beginner, I have to first train my eyes and brain to get used to many symbols used in this field. This takes time. In addition, terms such as ``expressively completeness'', ``formula'', ``free for'', ``quantifier'' (including ``term'' itself) are all new concepts to me, not mention that alternative names are used sometimes, for example, ``boolean function'' is also mentioned as ``truth function'' or ``logical function''. To get familiar with this ecosystem of logic terms also takes time.


Second, the inconsistent uses of symbols and notations cause confusion. For instance, in COMP6260's lectures, ``$\rightarrow$'' is used to indicate ``imply'', but in the various texts it recommends, ``$\Rightarrow$'' and ``$\vdash$'' are used instead. COMP6260 uses ``$F$'' for ``False'' while those texts use the symbol ``$\bot$''. For a beginner like me, anything that looks unfamiliar can cause confusion. In the early weeks, I often found myself searching for ``whats'' and ``whys'' for such inconsistency. This takes time.

Before I move on to the last reason, I must admit my failure to notice such time-consuming learning process in the early days of this semester. Back then, the other 3 courses I enrolled in did not stress me out at all because I have been quite familiar with academic writing and programming; I also already have some experience in database operations. I thought at that time I could handle all the above difficulties as I put more effort to it. I was so wrong.

%TODO: a minipage to show three deduction styles (genzten, box, fitch).
