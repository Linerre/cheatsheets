\item[address space] (of a process) contains all of the memory state of the
running program: the \textbf{code} of the program (the instructions); The running program uses a \textbf{stack} to keep track of where it is in function call chain as well as to allocate local variables and pass parameters and return values to and from routines; the \textbf{heap} is used for dynamically-allocated, user-managed memory, etc.  It is the running program’s view of memory in the system

\item[limited direct execution] let the program run directly on the hardware; however, at certain key points in time (such as when a process issues a system call, or a timer interrupt occurs), arrange so that the OS gets involved and makes sure the “right” thing happens.   Thus, the OS, with a little hardware support, tries best to get out of the way of the running program, to deliver an \emph{efficient} virtualization.

\item[lock] Generally, Programmers annotate source code with locks, putting them around critical sections, and thus ensure that any such critical section executes as if it were a single \textbf{atomic} instruction.

\item[LRU] least recently used: take advantage of locality in the memory-reference stream, assuming it is likely that an entry that has not recently been used is a good
candidate for eviction.

\item[most-recently-used (MRU)] MostFrequently-Used (MFU) and Most-Recently-Used (MRU). In most cases (not all!), these policies do not work well, as they ignore the locality most programs exhibit instead of embracing it.

\item[memory virtualization] OS maps user program address space to physical memory address.

\item[memory management unit] the part of the processor that helps with address translation (base and bounds registers kept on the chip).

\item[mutex] The name that the POSIX library uses for a lock, as it is used to provide mutual exclusion between threads, i.e., if one thread is in the critical section, it excludes the others from entering until it has completed the section.

\item[paging] Chop memory into \emph{fixed-sized} pieces, each called a \textbf{page}

\item[page frame] physical memory viewed as an array of fixed-sized slots called page frames; each of these frames can contain a single virtual-memory page.

\item[page table] s a per-process data structure maintained by OS.  Its major role is to store address translations for each of the virtual pages of the address space, thus letting us know where in physical memory each page resides.

\item[page fault] the act of accessing a page that is not in physical memory.  Upon a page fault, the OS is invoked to service the page fault.  Virtually all systems handle page faults in software.

\item[segmentation] Chop memory into \textsw{variable-sized} chunks and allocate them based on needs (e.g in base/bound or segmentation approaches)

\item[segmentation fault] a violation or error arising from a memory access on a segmented machine to an illegal address.

\item[sparse address space] large address spaces with large amounts of unused address space

\item[translation-lookaside buffer (TLB)] part of the chip’s memory-management unit (MMU), and is simply a hardware cache of popular virtual-to-physical address translations; thus, a better name would be an address-translation cache.

\item[time-space-trade-offs] Usually, if you wish to make access to a particular data structure faster, you will have to pay a space-usage penalty for the structure.

\item[virtual address] All that in user program address space
