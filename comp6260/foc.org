** Partial correctness specification
Notation: ={P} C {Q}=
P: pre-condition
C: code (specified programming language)
Q: post-condition

As a whole, it is called /partial correctness specification/.

** Total correctness specification
Notation: =[P] C [Q]=

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A total correctness specification [P] C [Q] is true if and only if the following
conditions apply:

(i) Whenever /C/ is executed in a state satisfying /P/, then execution of /C/ terminates.

(ii) After termination /Q/ holds.
