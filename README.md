This repo contains all the cheatsheets (written in LaTeX) that I used during studying computing courses at ANU.

Cheatsheets are gourped by courses they were made for. I made them public in case anyone finds them useful.

To use them (a.k.a printing out), you need to 
1. install TeXLive with all the packages required in `preamble.tex` files
2. run `latex` on specific cheatsheet to get the PDF
