% The 2-D wraparound mesh (torus) of \emph{p} processors: each row or column is a ring.
% Suppose the source node \emph{p} is $p_0$, located at the bottom row, left corner:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Phase 1: $p_0$ SF to others on the same row, taking same time as in \ref{eq:12allr}
% \item Phase 2: each \emph{p} of bottom row SF to others on their column, respectively and 4 columns SF in parallel, taking same time as in above step or in equation\ref{eq:12allr}
% \end{itemize}
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:12allmesh}
%   T_{\text{one-all}} = 2(t_s + t_{w}m) \frac{\sqrt{p}}{2}
% \end{equation}
% \section*{One-to-All 3-D Mesh Store-and-Forward (SF) Routing}
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:12all3m}
%   T_{\text{one-all}} = 3(t_s + t_{w}m) \frac{\sqrt[3]{p}}{2}
% \end{equation}
% $2^{d}$ procs hypercube $\rightleftharpoons$ $d$-D mesh with 2 procs in each dimension
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Total steps: \emph{d}, one in each dimension
% \item $d = \log_{2}p$ also written simply as $\log p$
% \item Each step is one-to-all broadcast on a 2-\emph{p} ring, a simple message transfer, taking $t_s + t_{w}m$, thus
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:12allh}
%   T_{\text{one-all}} = (t_s + t_{w}m) \log p
% \end{equation}
% \item One-to-all broadcast takes the \textbf{shortest} time (\ref{eq:12allh}) on a \emph{hypercube} because it has a higher connectivity than a ring or a mesh.
% \item One-to-all broadcast cannot be performed in a time less than (\ref{eq:12allh}) if:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item message is not routed in parts along separate paths
%   \item communication is allowed on \emph{only one} link of each p at a time
%   \end{enumerate}
% \item hypercube with CF \emph{cannot} improve T$_{\text{one-all}}$ due to nearest-neighbor communication
% \end{itemize}
