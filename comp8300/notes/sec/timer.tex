\section*{Overhead and resolution of timer}
\begin{itemize}
\item Timer \emph{overhead} is the amount of time it takes to call the timer function
\item Usually to measure the overhead for $n$ times and calc. the average
\item[] $T_{\text{overhead}} = \text{Average}(\text{overhead}_1,\text{overhead}_2,\cdots,\text{overhead}_n)$
\item The total time to run a program will be increased by $T_{\text{ overhead}} * m$ where $m$ is the number of times the timer is called
\item Timer \emph{resolution} is the period of time below which the timer will sometimes report a value of zero
\item[] $T_{\text{res}} = \texttt{MPI\_Wtime()/*end*/} - \texttt{MPI\_Wtime()/*start*/}$ (of type \texttt{double})
\item \texttt{MPI\_Wtick()} also gives the time resolution (of type \texttt{double})
\item The latency is the time to send an empty message but in some cases the smallest-sized message can be used to that end
\end{itemize}
